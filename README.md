## ECO32 musl Port
This is the official musl port for the ECO32.
It was ported as a part of my currently ongoing bachelor degree and to this date
is functional and can be compiled and used with the available Linux port inside the simulator.
Note that this port only supports static linking due to the fact that the current toolchain
does not support dynamic linking

## ECO32
ECO32 is a simple, fast 32-bit processor that runs C code, currently
without floating point operations. We want to execute some flavour
of UNIX on it, so it has got two operating modes (kernel/user) and
a memory management unit (paging with TLB support). The processor
was first simulated at the instruction set level, then at the HDL
level, and has finally been implemented in an FPGA.
